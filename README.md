### :question: Design pattern 
A reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software development.

#### Imagine :thought_balloon:
You are in an examination hall.<br/>
You find a question "**Given the value of radius = 5m , find the area of circle.**"
How will your solve the problem?<br/>
Obviously, using the formula ,<br/>

``` Area of circle = π r² , where π = 3.14``` 

##### Imagine :thought_balloon: 

Your question was something like "**Given the value of radius = 5m , find the area of circle without the help of a formula**". <br/>
In this scenario you are suppose to derive the formula by yourself and then solve the problem.

Similarly design pattern is nothing but some predefined solution (**Formula**) for some **commonly occuring problem** during development.

#### :exclamation: Important note :
- Never force a design pattern to a problem statement if not applicable
- Think and apply in a suitable places , it will definitely be your savior
